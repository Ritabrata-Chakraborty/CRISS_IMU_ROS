Publisher

The script first imports the necessary ROS libraries and message types.

The imu_publisher() function is defined.

The while loop continuously publishes IMU messages with a rate of 10 Hz.

The linear acceleration is set to a constant value of 2.5 m/s^2 on the x-axis and 9.8 m/s^2 on the z-axis, representing gravity.

The angular acceleration over the z-axis is varied from 1.0 to 10.0 by looping 100 times, with each iteration increasing the angular acceleration by 0.09.

The IMU message is published using the imu_pub publisher object.


Subscriber

The script first imports the necessary ROS libraries and message types.

The imu_callback(data) function is defined, which is called every time a new IMU message is received.

The linear and angular acceleration values are printed to the console using the print() function.

The imu_subscriber() function is defined.

The IMU subscriber is set up to listen to the imu_data topic, which is published by the IMU data publisher.

The imu_callback(data) function is called every time a new IMU message is received.


When both scripts are running, we should see the linear and angular acceleration values printed to the console in the subscriber terminal window.
